- By using different tools for extraction,transformation and loading huge amount of data (SSIS), analysis (Microsoft SQL Server) and visualization (Tableau) I am gaining much more insights from data and create some valuable conclusions about economy and its different sectors. 

- In the first part of the project I imported all csv files to SSMS using Foreach Loop Container. Folder processed_files was created just to catch processed file one by one so I can easily track ETL process. Standards and Data dictionary were also loaded to SSMS. All SSIS packages shared in repository. 

- In the next part I analysed data in SSMS using SQL. Queries with explanations are updated and loaded in repository. At the end of analysis I created a view, where I stored data of interest, after which I loaded from view from SSMS to flat file using SSIS. This flat file is later used for visualization in Tableau. 

- Last part of the project includes data analysis and visual presentation using Tableau Desktop version.
