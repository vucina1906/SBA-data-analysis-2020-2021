								CLEANING WITH SQL				

*** First we analyse and transform sba_industry_standards table. We want to extract from column NAICS_Industry_Description and get two new column, LookUpCode and Sector.


SELECT TOP (1000)
  [NAICS_Industry_Description],
  iif([NAICS_Industry_Description] like '%â€%', substring([NAICS_Industry_Description],8,2), '') LookUpCodes_if
  --case when [NAICS_Industry_Description] like '%â€%' then substring([NAICS_Industry_Description],8,2) else'' end LookupCodes_case
  FROM [Angelina_Frimpong].[dbo].[sba_industry_standards]
  where [NAICS_Codes] = ' '

*** After previous query we see that we are getting some empty fields that we would like to avoid so we are using subquery

from (
SELECT TOP (1000)
  [NAICS_Industry_Description],
  iif([NAICS_Industry_Description] like '%â€%', substring([NAICS_Industry_Description],8,2), '') LookUpCodes
  --case when [NAICS_Industry_Description] like '%â€%' then substring([NAICS_Industry_Description],8,2) else'' end LookupCodes_case
  FROM [Angelina_Frimpong].[dbo].[sba_industry_standards]
  where [NAICS_Codes] = ' ') as main
  where LookUpCodes != ' '

*** Than we exctrat sector names from NAICS_Industry_Description column

select * from (
SELECT TOP (1000)
  [NAICS_Industry_Description],
  iif([NAICS_Industry_Description] like '%â€%', substring([NAICS_Industry_Description],8,2), '') LookUpCodes,
  substring([NAICS_Industry_Description],CHARINDEX('€',[NAICS_Industry_Description])+3,len([NAICS_Industry_Description])) Sector
  FROM [Angelina_Frimpong].[dbo].[sba_industry_standards]
  where [NAICS_Codes] = ' ') as main
  where LookUpCodes != ' '

*** To avoid some newly created Sector fields contain empty characters we are using ltrim function and avoid that problem

select * from (
SELECT TOP (1000)
  [NAICS_Industry_Description],
  iif([NAICS_Industry_Description] like '%â€%', substring([NAICS_Industry_Description],8,2), '') LookUpCodes,
  ltrim(substring([NAICS_Industry_Description],CHARINDEX('€',[NAICS_Industry_Description])+3,len([NAICS_Industry_Description]))) Sector
  FROM [Angelina_Frimpong].[dbo].[sba_industry_standards]
  where [NAICS_Codes] = ' ') as main
  where LookUpCodes != ' '

*** Now we would like to save previous query as a new table called sba_naics_sector_codes_descriptions

select * into sba_naics_sector_codes_descriptions
from (
SELECT TOP (1000)
  [NAICS_Industry_Description],
  iif([NAICS_Industry_Description] like '%â€%', substring([NAICS_Industry_Description],8,2), '') LookUpCodes,
  ltrim(substring([NAICS_Industry_Description],CHARINDEX('€',[NAICS_Industry_Description])+3,len([NAICS_Industry_Description]))) Sector
  FROM [Angelina_Frimpong].[dbo].[sba_industry_standards]
  where [NAICS_Codes] = ' ') as main
  where LookUpCodes != ' '


*** Than we are examining newly created table sba_naics_sector_codes_descriptions. We can see that still in some rows we contain more than one sectors
so we have to insert nerw rows 

insert into [dbo].[sba_naics_sector_codes_descriptions]
  values
  ('Sector 31 â€“ 33 â€“ Manufacturing', 32,'Manufacturing'),
  ('Sector 31 â€“ 33 â€“ Manufacturing',33,'Manufacturing'),
  ('Sector 44 - 45 â€“ Retail Trade',45,'Retail Trade'),
  ('Sector 48 - 49 â€“ Transportation and Warehousing',49,'Transportation and Warehousing')

*** Also we clean the row where sector is 33 

update [dbo].[sba_naics_sector_codes_descriptions]
set Sector = 'Manufacturing'
where LookUpCodes = 31


							EXPLORING WITH SQL



*** We would like to explore and find out:

***What is summary of all approved PPP loans?

select count(LoanNumber) as Number_of_approved,
sum(InitialApprovalAmount) as Approved_Amount,
avg(InitialApprovalAmount) as Average_loan_size
FROM [Angelina_Frimpong].[dbo].[sba_public_data]

*** Now we compare year 2020 and 2021 using column DateApproved. We can see how much loans we had in 2020.

select 
year(DateApproved) as year_approved,
count(LoanNumber) as Number_of_approved,
sum(InitialApprovalAmount) as Approved_Amount,
avg(InitialApprovalAmount) as Average_loan_size
FROM [Angelina_Frimpong].[dbo].[sba_public_data]
where year(DateApproved) = 2020
group by year(DateApproved)
union 
select 
year(DateApproved) as year_approved,
count(LoanNumber) as Number_of_approved,
sum(InitialApprovalAmount) as Approved_Amount,
avg(InitialApprovalAmount) as Average_loan_size
FROM [Angelina_Frimpong].[dbo].[sba_public_data]
where year(DateApproved) = 2021
group by year(DateApproved)

*** Now we would like to check originating lenders to see who was giving the approvals for these loans?

select 
count(distinct OriginatingLender) OriginatingLender,
year(DateApproved) year_approved,
count(LoanNumber) as Number_of_approved,
sum(InitialApprovalAmount) as Approved_Amount,
avg(InitialApprovalAmount) as Average_loan_size
FROM [Angelina_Frimpong].[dbo].[sba_public_data]
where year(DateApproved) = 2020
group by year(DateApproved)

union 

select 
count(distinct OriginatingLender) OriginatingLender,
year(DateApproved) year_approved,
count(LoanNumber) as Number_of_approved,
sum(InitialApprovalAmount) as Approved_Amount,
avg(InitialApprovalAmount) as Average_loan_size
FROM [Angelina_Frimpong].[dbo].[sba_public_data]
where year(DateApproved) = 2021
group by year(DateApproved)

*** Our next intention is to check top 15 originating lenders by loan count, total amount and average in 2020 and 2021?

select top 15
OriginatingLender,
count(LoanNumber) as Number_of_approved,
sum(InitialApprovalAmount) as Approved_Amount,
avg(InitialApprovalAmount) as Average_loan_size
FROM [Angelina_Frimpong].[dbo].[sba_public_data]
where year(DateApproved) = 2020
group by OriginatingLender
order by Approved_Amount desc


*** Beside we checked how were the lenders we would like to analyse the industry that were getting these amounts? We are joining sba_public_data and sba_naics_sector_codes_descriptions
that we created before. 

select top 20 d.Sector,
count(LoanNumber) as Number_of_approved,
sum(InitialApprovalAmount) as Approved_Amount,
avg(InitialApprovalAmount) as Average_loan_size
FROM [Angelina_Frimpong].[dbo].[sba_public_data] as p
inner join [dbo].[sba_naics_sector_codes_descriptions] as d
on left(p.NAICSCode,2)=d.LookUpCodes
where year(DateApproved) = 2020
group by d.Sector
order by Approved_Amount desc

*** In previous query we are getting huge numbers that are hard to comprhend and use for analysis. We would like to make it more obvious so we will convert it to 
percentage. We we do CTE on previous query to achieve that.

with cte as (
select top 20 d.Sector,
count(LoanNumber) as Number_of_approved,
sum(InitialApprovalAmount) as Approved_Amount,
avg(InitialApprovalAmount) as Average_loan_size
FROM [Angelina_Frimpong].[dbo].[sba_public_data] as p
inner join [dbo].[sba_naics_sector_codes_descriptions] as d
on left(p.NAICSCode,2)=d.LookUpCodes
where year(DateApproved) = 2021
group by d.Sector)
select Sector,Number_of_approved,Approved_Amount,Average_loan_size,
Approved_Amount/sum(Approved_Amount) over() * 100 as Percent_by_Amount
from cte 
order by Percent_by_Amount desc

***Now we want to see how much of the PPP 2021 have been fully forgiven?

select count(LoanNumber) as Number_of_approved,
sum(CurrentApprovalAmount) as Current_Approved_Amount,
avg(CurrentApprovalAmount) as Current_Average_Loan_size,
sum(ForgivenessAmount) Amount_Forgiven,
sum(ForgivenessAmount)/sum(CurrentApprovalAmount)*100 percent_forgiven

FROM [Angelina_Frimpong].[dbo].[sba_public_data] as p
inner join [dbo].[sba_naics_sector_codes_descriptions] as d
on left(p.NAICSCode,2)=d.LookUpCodes
where year(DateApproved) = 2021
order by 3 desc

*** We see that there is huge difference between 2020 and 2021 so we would like to investigate deeper and check months also. These results 
seems logic becuase in 2020 we were facing COVID lockdown so SBA were giving much more loans to save small businesses.

select 
year(DateApproved) as Year_Approved,
month(DateApproved) as Month_Approved,
count(LoanNumber) as Number_of_Approved,
sum(InitialApprovalAmount) as Total_Net_Dollars,
avg(InitialApprovalAmount)as Average_loan_size
from [Angelina_Frimpong].[dbo].[sba_public_data]
group by year(DateApproved),month(DateApproved)
order by 4 desc

*** We would like to save our data that we were get using these queries so we will create a view that we will store later as a flat file, using SSIS, and connect it to Tableau for visualization.
This flat file should contain aproximately 1.9 milion rows.
